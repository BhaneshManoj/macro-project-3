# Macro-project-3: Business Fluctuations and Firm-Level Responses to Economic Crises

## Project Overview
This project analyzes business fluctuations and firm-level responses to economic crises, focusing on macroeconomic trends and microeconomic outcomes. The study is structured into three main parts:

   Cross-Country Business Cycle Analysis
   
   Event Study – The Global Financial Crisis & COVID-19 Recession (U.S.)
   
   Firm-Level Responses Using WRDS Compustat Data
   
The project combines macroeconomic trend analysis with firm-level data evaluation to understand the effects of economic downturns and how different economies and firms responded

## Project Structure
Part 1: Cross-Country Business Cycle Analysis

### Overview
Analyzes business cycle dynamics in the United States, Switzerland, and Japan from 2000 to 2024. Focuses on the cyclical relationships between output, labor, markets, and commodities. Utilizes data from FRED and applies the Hodrick-Prescott filter to decompose macroeconomic trends from short-term fluctuations. The analysis highlights procyclicality, volatility, and correlation patterns in manufacturing output, labor force participation, equity markets, and energy prices across the three countries.

Part 2: Event Study – The Global Financial Crisis & COVID-19 Recession (U.S.)

### Overview
The analysis uses historical data from FRED and Yahoo Finance to track Real GDP Growth, Unemployment Rates, and the S&P 500 Index before, during, and after each recession. The study describes the severity, duration, and recovery speed of both recessions. It incorporates references from prior research and macroeconomic reasoning to explain observed patterns. Policy responses—both fiscal and monetary—are documented, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) during the GFC and over $5 trillion in fiscal stimulus during COVID-19. 

Part 3: Firm-Level Responses Using WRDS Compustat Data

### Overview
Examines the responses of Apple, General Electric (GE), Ford, and Walmart to the Global Financial Crisis (2007–2009) using quarterly financial data from 2004 to 2012 (WRDS Compustat). The analysis focuses on Revenue Growth, Capital Expenditure (Capex), and Debt-to-Equity Ratios. It highlights sectoral differences in how firms managed demand shocks, investment decisions, and financial leverage, with insights into their resilience and recovery paths post-crisis.
