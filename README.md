# macro-project-3
This project examines business cycle fluctuations, economic crises, and firm-level responses using macroeconomic and microeconomic data. It is structured into three parts:

   # Cross-Country Business Cycle Analysis
   # Event Study â€“ The Global Financial Crisis & COVID-19 Recession (U.S.)
   # Firm-Level Responses Using WRDS Compustat Data
The objective is to analyze macroeconomic dynamics across countries, study how economies responded to two major recessions, and explore firm-level reactions to economic crises using high-frequency panel data.
